# Programming with Generative AI: Why?

A few days after the 30<sup>th</sup> of November 2022, intererst in Generative AI (GenAI) [exploded](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2022-01-01%202025-01-01&q=generative%20ai&hl=en-US). This technology was already sereval years old, so what happend on that day? [OpenAI released ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/). This tool made it _easy for many people_ to use GenAI. In other words, **ChatGPT democratized GenAI**. My goal is to show you how tools like ChatGPT can **democratize programming**.
